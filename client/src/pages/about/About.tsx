					The Smart Talk is an online tool designed to help parents empower
					their children to become smart digital citizens in an increasingly
					connected world. It was created in collaboration between National PTA
					and NortonLifeLock in 2015, and since then has gained support from
					leading platforms and entities. The Smart Talk is updated on a rolling
					basis using feedback provided by parents who attend National PTA
					digital well-being events.

						ABOUT PTA CONNECTED
					</Text>
				</Box>
				<Text typography='text' size={16}>
					National PTA launched its PTA Connected initiative in 2018 to build on
					its work in the digital space to meet the growing needs and interest
					of parents nationwide. The goal of the initiative is to deepen the
					understanding and knowledge of parents, families and teachers about
					digital safety tools and resources (such as The Smart Talk); mobilize
					PTAs, schools and communities to engage families around best practices
					and shared learning; and generate collective impact. NortonLifeLock is
					the presenting and founding sponsor of PTA Connected; other
					corporations and nonprofits additionally support this important work.
